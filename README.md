# POSTURE-ANALYSIS-SYSTEM
This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to monitor and analyze human posture for physiotherapy and personal training. By detecting body alignment, head tilt, slouching, and movement patterns in real-time, the system provides corrective feedback, tracks posture history, and supports remote physiotherapy sessions.
